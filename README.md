# 'gitgood' repository

A repository to learn how to use Git.

## Section 1
How to get good at version control.

git status
git diff (our current literal state + last COMMIT as default, can choose commit though, even multiple, even with specific files!)
git log
git switch - don;t knoe yet
git checkout commit_id filename (transitions between points in time of our repository, like the head is moved, filename optional) -> you haven't lost anything!
